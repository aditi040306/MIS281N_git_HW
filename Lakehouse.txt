Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics (CIDR 2021) — 
https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf


I chose this paper because it directly speaks to the kind of challenges I’ve faced while working with large-scale data systems. It introduces the idea of a “Lakehouse”,a new architecture that combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses. For someone like me, who’s been involved in backend development, system design, and now studying data strategy and analytics, this felt very relevant.

The Lakehouse approach simplifies things  it cuts down on data duplication, reduces costs, and supports both analytics and machine learning without needing separate systems. What really stood out to me is how it avoids vendor lock-in and works with open formats, which gives teams a lot more flexibility. If you're responsible for designing scalable data stacks or making decisions about tools and infrastructure, this paper offers a practical and forward-looking solution.



Article argues that the split between data lakes and data warehouses creates duplication, staleness, and cost. A “lakehouse” keeps open file formats (like Parquet/ORC) but adds warehouse-grade features—ACID transactions, indexing, caching, governance—so one platform can serve both BI and ML reliably and fast.




Key Summary :
 
Why Traditional Architectures Fall Short :
Too many data copies: Moving data back and forth between systems causes bloat, delays, and governance issues.
Data gets stale: ETL pipelines introduce lag, which affects real-time decision-making.
Not ML-friendly: Warehouses are great for SQL, but not optimized for machine learning workflows or unstructured data.
Vendor lock-in: Many systems use proprietary formats and tight coupling between compute and storage.
High complexity: Managing two separate systems (and all the pipelines between them) leads to more operational overhead and risk.


What the Lakehouse Solves :
Uses open formats like Parquet for broad compatibility and flexibility.
Adds a metadata and transaction layer to support ACID compliance, schema enforcement, versioning, and governance.
Supports both BI/SQL workloads and machine learning, without needing to export or duplicate data.
Achieves warehouse-grade performance through smart layout, caching, and indexing.
Simplifies architecture by consolidating everything into one platform.

Overall, the Lakehouse concept is a strong, practical solution for teams trying to balance analytics, ML, performance, and cost — without being locked into a rigid or overly complex architecture. It aligns well with my background in backend systems and my interest in building modern, scalable data platforms.
